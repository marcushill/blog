## So that resolution died fast, right?

Yea. Yea. I started a blog for New Years' last year, and here I am again. So what happened?

2020 and all its craziness is what happened to me. In the past twelve months (ignoring my trip to Europe when I originally built this site), I have:

1. Got really sick in February and spent Valentine's Day tracking down problems at work while slowly coming down with what was *probably* a lousy cold.
2. Had laser eye surgery (no more glasses :smile:)
3. Got a new job at Microsoft working with Azure SQL. I've started leading a small project with two junior engineers. 
4. Packed up some electronics and a few clothes and left the expensive apartment for which I was still paying rent to move in with someone so that we wouldn't be alone during the lockdown.
5. Started about five different side projects that didn't stick. 
6. Moved *again* into a lovely townhome. We moved in together for real this time. :grin:
7. Visited Rainier National Park for the first time (so pretty)
8. Acquired a new server and done a bunch of work in my little homelab
9. Got promoted to L62 :party:
10. Started writing again (currently working on two stories), one of which will probably be serialized and linked here. 

This all makes me sound super productive, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. In reality, I've slept a lot, read a lot of garbage fiction, and played a bunch of video games just like everyone else. 

With all of that going on (and I'm sure I've missed something), I just haven't had the chance to blog very much. I am working on a site for one of my writing projects, though. Since I'm already in the mood, I thought, "why not update your own blog?"




2020 wasn't anyone's year, but maybe 2021 will treat us all a little better.
