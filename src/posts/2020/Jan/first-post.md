So I've decided it's about high time that I start (or really revive) my writing habit and start a blog. People have been telling me to do this for a while and [Devon's blog]() which I ran in to while hanging out on the Joplin forum really inspired me to do so. 

The goal is a lot like her stated goal: relatively frequent, incredibly informal updates. And of course, as a developer I'll likely fiddle with the site a little (or a lot). I'm currently writing this at way too early in the morning from a hotel room in Austria, but I hope to publish this site (along with the first few updates) not too long after I get back home to Seattle.

For now, I simply say "Tsch√ºss" and direct you to the (hopefully always up to date)  [about page](/about).
